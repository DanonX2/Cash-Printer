I thought that Quantopian might be a better platform that just using TDAmeritrade APIs since there is almost no resourses about their APIs which made it extrmely confusing to understand for me who has not much experience working with API which result taking too long for basic tasks for example getting price data for a certian stock which can be done very easily with Quantopian platform which provides a lot of free data which is easy to acssess but sometime taking a long time to load for whatever reason but the problem with it is that the platform has its own notebook server which has its own rule of grammer and also limited on the web browser and it does not aloww people to actually live trade by themself because obviously Quantopian is not a brookerfirm which means it can only be used as a stradgy reserch platform and the actual order excution which might be another platfrom i didnt know of because the only one i konw of right now is TD and i dont really want to pick that up again becasue all the confusion and lack of help in the community. <b>So, the purpose of this brach so far is to test out the Quantopian platform. If its a ideal platform for me Ill use it as a reaserch platform offen. But, again, the actuall order excution will be done on another platform which is very annoying</b>. i really hope quantopian can provide user the opptunity to place real order based on their algorithms but it seems just not going to happen any time soon. with really litte knowlege i will have to figure everything and test them out by myself:(  It will be great if im able to meet some people who has more experience than me and willing to teach me. But i cant jsut expect someoen will willing to teach me so i got to work hard as well.
